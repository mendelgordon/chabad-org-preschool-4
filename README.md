# Preschool template

This is where I'm storing code and assets for a preschool template, but the template will be used in the chabadone system, never on its own.
The html files are incomplete because they only contain the minisite template, not the shell around the template, and because the code gets processed server side by the chabadone system before it's presented on the client. 
The css files are incomplete because they only contain the minisite template css, not the css for the rest of the page.
